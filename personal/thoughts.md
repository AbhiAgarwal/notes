- When writing code you've to try and understand the APIs you are calling. The stack behind them is important. For example in Twitter's API their time formating is done using Ruby's time formating, and so you've to try and understand that before you parse things, and just look at how Ruby's stdlib handles it rather than just parsing it.
	- Consider the stacks behind the API.

- The world is quite easy to change, and people have been changing it for a while without knowing. The every day person makes a change. For example, take artificial selection. Animal breeders used to take species are breed them in some way to get some result - it did change the world because now we might not have a breed we had before because it adapted, and changed in lots of ways. They could've taken the cow that gave the most milk, and wasn't the whitest because they didn't care about the milk, but now we don't have the same white cows anymore.
	- Just shows impact of an individual person as through his life-time he can make a small change that leaves his part of the world without something or with something new.

- I want to become an expert on knowledge, and how it can be represented. I'm very passionate about starting things that have to revolve around knowledge, and how one can maintain and build it.
	- The best way to make a difference in something is to become an expert at it.

- OneNYU
	- Peopl@NYU
		- I think this is very important thing to do at NYU. It's to give everyone a voice and a name. Everyone can be heard, and everyone can share their projects, their ideas, and just express themselves.
			- I don't know what the best way of doing this is, but we can take pictures of students from Instagram or people on Twitter, etc.
	- Events
		- Abhinay does this well with his app. But I think it's incredible to bring in Meetup, and other platforms into this.
	- Platform
		- I can surely use Tech@NYU's platform as inspiration to this. Ethan does some incredible work on it, and I like the structure of the application. Maybe think about this.
	- Redis
		- We can power this by Redis. We are able to put all of these things into key-value stores, and then load them. We just need to run a seperate background application to get this data and put it into a key-value store then filter. 
		- Doing this without extensive caching will kill everything and the website will surely die.

- Traditional education is designed for people to scale to everyone. The current education system is designed to be the best for most individuals, but not every individual fits into the system. 
	- It's thought to have designed for a society of people where you only need what you learn at college to get a job. That's clearly not true anymore, there's a lot more in play now then a college education. People now have to do a lot more things than before to guarantee a job in the future, and so people now do internships, and research even during their school work. 
	- MBA's were created at the time where it was becoming harder and harder to get a job, and because society needed more specialist people than before because the education system wasn't able to keep up. So they created Business Schools, but the current education system hasn't been able to keep up with the skills required today. 
	- Traditional education routes haven't changed so much since then -> there aren't many new "schools" than there were then. Sure technology has evolved, but Engineering degrees haven't changed that much either. There just have been new degrees you can get such as Computer Science. 

- Horizontal or extensive progress basically means copying things that work.
	- China is going for Horizontal progress. 

- [Interesting](http://blakemasters.com/post/20400301508/cs183class1):
	- Path’s limiting its users to 150 “friends” is illustrative of this point. 
	- Ancient tribes apparently had a natural size limit that didn’t much exceed that number. 
	- Startups are important because they are small; if the size and complexity of a business is something like the square of the number of people in it, then startups are in a unique position to lower interpersonal or internal costs and thus to get stuff done.

- Learning everything is quite useless. Learn things you think are important, and you think are going to change how you feel about whatever you do.
	- For example, if you enjoy doing (X), and you aren't satisfied with it then how can you change (X) to your benefit? 
	- Then see if everyone else agrees. If not then build it anyways, and see if it works. If you don't like it - try something else!
	- Try development by things you like, and test them out. If you like them then keep them, and move on. Don't try and form ideas based on what the market needs - I think there's a good need for many things in the market. 
		- But you should target things you like because you don't want to waste your time just building random crap, and building a company you just want for money.
		- Money to live is easy to come by if you want it to. Or if you've a decent education. There's money in the world somewhere for you - so don't start a company just for it. It will turn out that it will be harder for you in the long run.
	- Build a company you clearly think will succeed in the long run. Don't try and build things like a timer for a pancake maker, or a timer for anything that can be done using some common sense.
	- Think of big ideas, and things that you think could influence the world. Technologies that could change what you think of the world, and how you would want to interact with it.
	- Anything you want to see in the real world that you think could really change how you use the Internet or change how you use technology, or even physical objects.
