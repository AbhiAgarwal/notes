This paper characterizes the key component of humanity as intelligence, and suggests that if you were of a lower intelligence you were of a different species. Judgement of a whole population was also made on basis of a couple test subjects, and whole civilizations were put into rank by the size of the brain, and not the content or the use of it.

The key question: What is intelligence? How do we measure it? Is it the size of our heads or is it our education? Can someone with a larger brain and no education have more "intelligence" than a person with a smaller brain and a lifetime of education? 

How do you pass judgement on a whole population depending on a couple test subjects? Can you just value a whole civilization, their thoughts, work, and education by judging how large their skull is?

How do you characterize a whole extinct civilization as a particular race, and not the other on the basis of their skull size? (The Egyptians). 

There has to be a racial bias, but I believe it can't be too much. He himself is American, and he has ranked the American Family 15th on his list. If there existed a racial bias - wouldn't he have moved it higher up? Is it a bias particularly just against the Ethiopian race?

Why does intelligence make people a "lower grade of humanity?".
