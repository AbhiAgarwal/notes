- Traditional education is designed for people to scale to everyone. The current education system is designed to be the best for most individuals, but not every individual fits into the system. 
	- It's thought to have designed for a society of people where you only need what you learn at college to get a job. That's clearly not true anymore, there's a lot more in play now then a college education. People now have to do a lot more things than before to guarantee a job in the future, and so people now do internships, and research even during their school work. 
	- MBA's were created at the time where it was becoming harder and harder to get a job, and because society needed more specialist people than before because the education system wasn't able to keep up. So they created Business Schools, but the current education system hasn't been able to keep up with the skills required today. 
	- Traditional education routes haven't changed so much since then -> there aren't many new "schools" than there were then. Sure technology has evolved, but Engineering degrees haven't changed that much either. There just have been new degrees you can get such as Computer Science. 

- Horizontal or extensive progress basically means copying things that work.
	- China is going for Horizontal progress.
