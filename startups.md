# Notes from Notes of Peter Thiel’s CS183 Startup

**Introduction**

- A fundamental challenge—in business as in life—is to integrate the micro and macro such that all things make sense.

- Humanities majors may well learn a great deal about the world. But they don’t really learn career skills through their studies. Engineering majors, conversely, learn in great technical detail. 
	- But they might not learn **why, how, or where they should apply their skills in the workforce**.
	- The best students, workers, and thinkers will integrate these questions into a cohesive narrative. This course aims to facilitate that process.

**History of Technology**

- Perhaps 100 billion people have ever lived on earth. Most of them lived in essentially stagnant societies. So the massive technological acceleration of the past few hundred years is truly incredible.

- For most of recent human history—from the invention of the steam engine in the late 17th century through about the late 1960’s or so— technological progress has been tremendous, perhaps even relentless. 

- In most prior human societies, people made money by taking it from others. The industrial revolution wrought a paradigm shift in which people make money through trade, not plunder.

- The zenith of optimism about the future of technology might have been the 1960’s. **People believed in the future. They thought about the future**. Many were supremely confident that the next 50 years would be a half-century of unprecedented technological progress.

**The Case For Computer Science**

- Median wages have been stagnant since 1973. People find themselves in an alarming Alice-in-Wonderland-style scenario in which they must run harder and harder—that is, work longer hours—just to stay in the same place.
	- This deceleration is complex, and wage data alone don’t explain it. But they do support the general sense that the rapid progress of the last 200 years is slowing all too quickly.

- Computers have been the happy exception to recent tech deceleration. Moore’s/Kryder’s/Wirth’s laws have largely held up, and forecast continued growth. 

**The Future For Progress**

- Globalization and Tech: Horizontal vs. Vertical Progress
	- Progress comes in two flavors: horizontal/extensive and vertical/intensive:
		- **Horizontal or extensive progress basically means copying things that work**. In one word, it means simply “globalization.” (Consider what China will be like in 50 years. The safe bet is it will be a lot like the United States is now. Cities will be copied, cars will be copied, and rail systems will be copied. Maybe some steps will be skipped. But it’s copying all the same.)
		- **Vertical or intensive progress, by contrast, means doing new things**. The single word for this is “technology.” Intensive progress involves going from 0 to 1 (not simply the 1 to n of globalization). 
		- As a society, we seem to believe in a sort of technological end of history, almost by default.
		- It’s worth noting that globalization and technology do have some interplay; we shouldn’t falsely dichotomize them.
			- Consider resource constraints as a 1 to n subproblem. Maybe not everyone can have a car because that would be environmentally catastrophic. If 1 to n is so blocked, only 0 to 1 solutions can help. 
		- **Technological development is thus crucially important, even if all we really care about is globalization.**

**The Problems of 0 to 1**

- Maybe we focus so much on going from 1 to n because that’s easier to do. 
- **There’s little doubt that going from 0 to 1 is qualitatively different, and almost always harder, than copying something n times.**
- And even trying to achieve vertical, 0 to 1 progress presents the challenge of exceptionalism; any founder or inventor doing something new must wonder: am I sane? Or am I crazy?

**The Educational and Narrative Challenge**

- **Education is fundamentally about going from 1 to n**. We observe, imitate, and repeat. 
	- **Infants do not invent new languages; they learn existing ones**. From early on, we learn by copying what has worked before. 
-  That is insufficient for startups. Crossing T’s and dotting I’s will get you maybe 30% of the way there. (It’s certainly necessary to get incorporation right, for instance. And one can learn how to pitch VCs.)
-  But at some point you have to go from 0 to 1—you have to do something important and do it right—and that can’t be taught. 	- All successful companies are different; they figured out the 0 to 1 problem in different ways. But all failed companies are the same; they botched the 0 to 1 problem.

**Determinism vs. Indeterminism**

- Among the toughest questions about progress is the question of how we should assess a venture’s probability of success.
	- In the 1 to n paradigm, it’s a statistical question. You can analyze and predict. But in the 0 to 1 paradigm, it’s not a statistical question; the standard deviation with a sample size of 1 is infinite. There can be no statistical analysis; statistically, we’re in the dark.
- Going from 0 to 1 always has to favor determinism over indeterminism. 
	- But there is a practical problem with this. We have a word for people who claim to know the future: prophets. And in our society, all prophets are false prophets.

**The Future of Intensive Growth**

- There are four theories about the future of intensive progress.
	- **convergence**: Starting with the industrial revolution, we saw a quick rise in progress, but technology will decelerate and growth will become asymptotic.
	- **cyclical theory**: Technological progress moves in cycles; advances are made, retrenchments ensue. Repeat. This has probably been true for most of human history in the past. But it’s hard to imagine it remaining true; to think that we could somehow lose all the information and know-how we’ve amassed and be doomed to have to re-discover it strains credulity.
	- **collapse/destruction**: Some technological advance will do us in.
	- **singularity**: Where technological development yields some AI or intellectual event horizon.

- People tend to overestimate the likelihood or explanatory power of the convergence and cyclical theories. **Accordingly, they probably underestimate the destruction and singularity theories**.
