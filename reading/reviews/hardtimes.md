I thought it was an interesting approach to a criticism to the education system that was put in place at that time, and also applicable to the present day. Individuals are fed knowledge upon knowledge, and are taught to apply those things to different scenarios, but they aren't taught to be creative and come up with scenarios. I thought it was interesting because his depiction of a child's mind as a vessel that is "ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured" creates this very intense imagery of rote-learning. 

They teach you to quantify and take out values from scenarios and then apply them to generic formulas - like in most science classes. We can link this to defining a horse - you're just taught this formulations of horse, and you're simply taught to apply them in generic situations (horse can be substituted anywhere). Questions like is this right? Can all this really be the "hard facts"?

Why would you try to define a horse? or is defining a horse in a way as absurd as some of the things we try formulate at school? 

His relation of age difference in marriage and happiness brings a very Quetelet feel to it. The absurdity in this is that has he even measured such things? Or can we just simply take it as true if no one has complained before? Or if there is no data in the past relating those should we just think it's positive? 

Is there a way to teach individuals how to understand the facts and be creative? He shows two extremes where one is knowledgeable of facts, and one is not but is very creative.
