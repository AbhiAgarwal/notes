# How to Start a Startup class

- Time allocation: talk to customers & build product
- Build something small number of users love and something that when developed more people can love
	- You make something that a lot of users like a little bit or small number of users love
		- Much easier to expand from small number of users love
		- Expand from small number of users > Expand from lots of users who like
	- If you get this wrong then you can do everything well, but still fail
	- This is one thing you need to care about until it is working
	- iPhone was the first smartphone people really loved
- User Feedback -> Product Decision -> Show it to Users cycle
	- User Feedback: What do they like? What would they pay for? What would make them recommend it?
	- Watch them use it
	- Would they be bummed if the company goes away?
- Focus on growth: Total registrations, active users, activity levels, cohort retention, revenue, net promoter score
- There's an opportunity cost of time of the people who follow you in your project. You're the lead - you're the boss, and you can't waste their time if you don't know what your idea is or can't execute on it.
- Option pool creation
	- The option pool is a way of attracting talented employees to a startup company - if the employees help the company do well enough to go public, they will be compensated with stock

# Startup Notes

<h3>My notes from Peter Thiel’s CS183: Startup - Class Notes</h3>

**Introduction**

- A fundamental challenge—in business as in life—is to integrate the micro and macro such that all things make sense.

- Humanities majors may well learn a great deal about the world. But they don’t really learn career skills through their studies. Engineering majors, conversely, learn in great technical detail. 
	- But they might not learn **why, how, or where they should apply their skills in the workforce**.
	- The best students, workers, and thinkers will integrate these questions into a cohesive narrative.

**History of Technology**

- Perhaps 100 billion people have ever lived on earth. Most of them lived in essentially stagnant societies. So the massive technological acceleration of the past few hundred years is truly incredible.

- For most of recent human history—from the invention of the steam engine in the late 17th century through about the late 1960’s or so— technological progress has been tremendous, perhaps even relentless. 

- In most prior human societies, people made money by taking it from others. The industrial revolution wrought a paradigm shift in which people make money through trade, not plunder.

- The zenith of optimism about the future of technology might have been the 1960’s. **People believed in the future. They thought about the future**. Many were supremely confident that the next 50 years would be a half-century of unprecedented technological progress.

**The Case For Computer Science**

- Median wages have been stagnant since 1973. People find themselves in an alarming Alice-in-Wonderland-style scenario in which they must run harder and harder—that is, work longer hours—just to stay in the same place.
	- This deceleration is complex, and wage data alone don’t explain it. But they do support the general sense that the rapid progress of the last 200 years is slowing all too quickly.

- Computers have been the happy exception to recent tech deceleration. Moore’s/Kryder’s/Wirth’s laws have largely held up, and forecast continued growth. 

**The Future For Progress**

- Globalization and Tech: Horizontal vs. Vertical Progress
	- Progress comes in two flavors: horizontal/extensive and vertical/intensive:
		- **Horizontal or extensive progress basically means copying things that work**. In one word, it means simply “globalization.” (Consider what China will be like in 50 years. The safe bet is it will be a lot like the United States is now. Cities will be copied, cars will be copied, and rail systems will be copied. Maybe some steps will be skipped. But it’s copying all the same.)
			- China is currently taking things from innovating companies and replicating the technology behind them. They are basically just copying and making the product cheaper for mass consumption. This is Horizontal progress. 
			- China is great at reproducing products, and reducing their market price by using cheaper goods. However, China hasn't shown much advancement in innovating new products.
		- **Vertical or intensive progress, by contrast, means doing new things**. The single word for this is “technology.” Intensive progress involves going from 0 to 1 (not simply the 1 to n of globalization). 
		- As a society, we seem to believe in a sort of technological end of history, almost by default.
		- It’s worth noting that globalization and technology do have some interplay; we shouldn’t falsely dichotomize them.
			- Consider resource constraints as a 1 to n subproblem. Maybe not everyone can have a car because that would be environmentally catastrophic. If 1 to n is so blocked, only 0 to 1 solutions can help. 
		- **Technological development is thus crucially important, even if all we really care about is globalization.**

- You can think 0 to 1 to mean: creating the first product. To build the first product you've to innovate, and reach some efficiency. You've to go from zero to one, and the numbers between them is the progress you make.

- However, it becomes a different problem when you come to 1 to n. This is reproducing the first product n times. So this is no longer the same type of technology advancement, but could also be seen as an advancement in manufacturing. 

**The Problems of 0 to 1**

- Maybe we focus so much on going from 1 to n because that’s easier to do. 
- **There’s little doubt that going from 0 to 1 is qualitatively different, and almost always harder, than copying something n times.**
- And even trying to achieve vertical, 0 to 1 progress presents the challenge of exceptionalism; any founder or inventor doing something new must wonder: am I sane? Or am I crazy?

**The Educational and Narrative Challenge**

- **Education is fundamentally about going from 1 to n**. We observe, imitate, and repeat. 
	- **Infants do not invent new languages; they learn existing ones**. From early on, we learn by copying what has worked before. 
-  That is insufficient for startups. Crossing T’s and dotting I’s will get you maybe 30% of the way there. (It’s certainly necessary to get incorporation right, for instance. And one can learn how to pitch VCs.)

-  But at some point you have to go from 0 to 1—you have to do something important and do it right—and that can’t be taught. 	- All successful companies are different; they figured out the 0 to 1 problem in different ways. But all failed companies are the same; they botched the 0 to 1 problem.

**Determinism vs. Indeterminism**

<u>Background</u>

- Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event, including human action, there exist conditions that could cause no other event.
	- *"Nothing occurs at random, but everything for a reason and by necessity." - Leucippus*
	- Determinism is the philosophical idea that every event or state of affairs, including every human decision and action, is the inevitable and necessary consequence of antecedent states of affairs.

- Indeterminism is the concept that events are not caused, or not caused deterministically by prior events. It is related to chance. 
	- In science, most specifically quantum theory in physics, indeterminism is the belief that no event is certain and the entire outcome of anything is a probability.

<u>Thought</u>	

- Among the toughest questions about progress is the question of how we should assess a venture’s probability of success.
	- In the 1 to n paradigm, it’s a statistical question. You can analyze and predict. But in the 0 to 1 paradigm, it’s not a statistical question; the standard deviation with a sample size of 1 is infinite. There can be no statistical analysis; statistically, we’re in the dark.

- Going from 0 to 1 always has to favor determinism over indeterminism. 
	- But there is a practical problem with this. We have a word for people who claim to know the future: prophets. And in our society, all prophets are false prophets.

**The Future of Intensive Growth**

- There are four theories about the future of intensive progress.
	- **convergence**: Starting with the industrial revolution, we saw a quick rise in progress, but technology will decelerate and growth will become asymptotic.
	- **cyclical theory**: Technological progress moves in cycles; advances are made, retrenchments ensue. Repeat. This has probably been true for most of human history in the past. But it’s hard to imagine it remaining true; to think that we could somehow lose all the information and know-how we’ve amassed and be doomed to have to re-discover it strains credulity.
	- **collapse/destruction**: Some technological advance will do us in.
	- **singularity**: Where technological development yields some AI or intellectual event horizon.

- People tend to overestimate the likelihood or explanatory power of the convergence and cyclical theories. **Accordingly, they probably underestimate the destruction and singularity theories**.

**Why Companies?**

- Application of [Coase Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem)
	- Coase theorem: describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities.
	- Companies exist because they optimally address internal and external coordination costs.
	- As an entity grows, so do its internal coordination costs. But its external coordination costs fall.
	- Optimality—firm size—is a matter of finding the right combination. Combination of external coordination costs and internal coordination costs.

**Why Startups?**

<u>Costs Matter</u>

- Size and internal vs. external coordination costs matter a lot.
	- North of 100 people in a company, employees don’t all know each other. Politics become important. Incentives change. Signaling that work is being done may become more important than actually doing work. These costs are almost always underestimated.
	- *Yet they are so prevalent that professional investors should and do **seriously reconsider before investing in companies that have more than one office**.*
	- Hiring consultants and trying to outsource key development projects are, for similar reasons, serious red flags.
	
<u>Issues</u>

- Severe coordination problems may stem from something as seemingly trivial or innocuous as a company having a multi-floor office. 

- Hiring consultants and trying to outsource key development projects are, for similar reasons, serious red flags.
	- Shows a lack of community, perhaps?
- Employees don’t all know each other. Politics become important. Incentives change. Signaling that work is being done may become more important than actually doing work.

<u>Why startups are important</u>

- Startups are important because they are small; if the size and complexity of a business is something like the square of the number of people in it, then startups are in a unique position to lower interpersonal or internal costs and thus to get stuff done.

<u>Why startups then?</u>

-  Because you can’t develop new technology in existing entities.

-  Anyone on a mission tends to want to go from 0 to 1. You can only do that if you’re surrounded by others to want to go from 0 to 1. That happens in startups, not huge companies or government.

<u>Cost of failure</u>

- Startups pay less than bigger companies. So founding or joining one involves some financial loss. These losses are generally thought to be high. In reality, they aren’t that high. 

- The non-financial costs are actually higher. If you do a failed startup, you may not have learned anything useful.
	- You may actually have learned how to fail again. You may become more risk-averse. 

- **You aren’t a lottery ticket, so you shouldn’t think of failure as just 1 of n times that you’re going to start a company. The stakes are a bit bigger than that.**

- A 0 to 1 startup involves low financial costs but low non-financial costs too. You’ll at least learn a lot and probably will be better for the effort. 

- A 1 to n startup, though, has especially low financial costs, but higher non-financial costs.

**Where to Start?**

- The path from 0 to 1 might start with asking and answering three questions. 
	- First, what is valuable? 
		- Illustrates the difference between business and academia.
	- Second, what can I do? 
		- Ensures that you can actually execute on a problem.
	- Third, what is nobody else doing?
		- Is the importance of being novel
		- What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
		- What valuable company is nobody building? 

-  Make no mistake; it’s a hard question. 

-  Knowing what 0 to 1 endeavor is worth pursuing is incredibly rare, unique, and tricky. But the process, if not the result, can also be richly rewarding.
