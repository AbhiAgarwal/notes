Durkheim

Suicide has to be dealt with from a micro and macro level, the different categories of suicide depend the levels of on moral behavior in a society, and how well people are connected and depended on each other. I also found it hard to believe about the religious suicide differences as it seemed like a bias rather than an observation - there wasn't much information on why it was the case just that one might have had a worse community.

Why are suicide rates higher when there is peace than there is war? One of the things he points out, and is hard to agree with. One of the things that doesn't seem normal. 

Was he allowed to make these observations about individuals? He was clearly looking at it from a group perspective, and I thought it was unfair for him to make judgements about individuals. 

Confusion:

In an altruistic society he points out that the exception is when a person is excepted to kill themselves on behalf of society. That seems a little tough to understand, and I think I maybe don't quite understand what an altruistic society is. Is it just a society which is well integrated, and people do things for the greater good of the society, and not themselves? But in that case why would an individual feel like he is expected to kill himself? I don't understand how a person can feel like that's his duty? I guess it depends on the perspective - would an example be someone taking a bomb from a location to kill himself but save a lot of the other people? Or is it by going to military they are already performing this act?
