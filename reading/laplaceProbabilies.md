Laplace lays out a mathematical foundation of reasoning using probability, demonstrates some of the practical uses and cases where one would use this system of mathematics, and shows the assumptions we make when using the system that he has proposed. Laplace wanted to create a system to understand how to calculate chance of an event occurring relative to us, and how things affect one another when we make assumptions.
