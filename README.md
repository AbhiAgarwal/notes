**Things to learn**

<p>To give me a good general background in Computer Science, and allow me to branch out in the future - I want to study the following things at University. I want to build on them and to understand how these things operate, and be able to apply most of these concepts.</p>

<p>Crossing out doesn't mean I have reached my goal in these languages, but just means that I have developed a decent understanding of them</p>

<p>I want to try and understand these ideas. Not just from a developer's prespective, but also from a mathematicians side. So that means that try and understand how they are implemented, and not just how to use them.</p>

- Algorithm Design
- Artificial Intelligence (NLP, Vision, Speech, Movement)
- Robotics (Mechanics, Electrical, Computer)
- Parallel Programming (OpenCL, OpenMP, CUDA)
- Languages (~~Node.js, Javascript, Python,~~ Haskell, ~~Java, C++~~)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV), and Computer Graphics
- Machine Learning (Theory, Frameworks (scikit-learn, etc), and Kaggle)
- Deep Learning (Neural nets)
- Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Inequality, Dimensionality, Calculus)
- Physics (Kinemetics)
- Simulation (~~N-body, Diseases, Traffic~~, Movement, Social)
- Networking (Packets, TCP/IP, Packet Sniffing)
- Competitive Programming (~~UVA, Algorithmic efficiency~~)

<p>Interests in understanding these concepts</p>

- Brain (Visual cortex -> V1, V2, ..., Neurons, etc)

<p>Away from academia</p>

- Social Media (How people response/react to)
- Marketing
- Entreprunership
