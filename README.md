**Things to learn**

<p>To give me a good general background in Computer Science, and allow me to branch out in the future - I want to study the following things at University. I want to build on them and to understand how these things operate, and be able to apply most of these concepts.</p>

<p>Crossing out doesn't mean I have reached my goal in these languages, but just means that I have developed a decent understanding of them</p>

<p>I want to try and understand these ideas. Not just from a developer's prespective, but also from a mathematicians side. So that means that try and understand how they are implemented, and not just how to use them.</p>
