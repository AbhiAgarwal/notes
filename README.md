My written notes are all over the place, and so is my writing. So I'm going to try and centralize it here for myself.

Concentration on languages: C++, Javascript, and Go. I'm just going to be using these languages for the next couple years of my life - it's better to perfect myself with a couple languages rather than having learnt all the languages not too well.

**Reference the Wiki page for my quick notes.**

**Things to learn**

<p>To give me a good general background in Computer Science, and allow me to branch out in the future - I want to study the following things at University. I want to build on them and to understand how these things operate, and be able to apply most of these concepts.</p>

<p>Crossing out doesn't mean I have reached my goal in these languages, but just means that I have developed a decent understanding of them</p>

<p>I want to try and understand these ideas. Not just from a developer's prespective, but also from a mathematicians side. So that means that try and understand how they are implemented, and not just how to use them.</p>

<p>Also these are concepts I want to learn on a more fundamental level. These concepts are fairly hard to start approach on a more advanced level.</p>

- Algorithm Design
- Artificial Intelligence (NLP, Vision, Speech, Movement)

<p>Interests in understanding these concepts</p>

- Brain (Visual cortex -> V1, V2, ..., Neurons, etc)
