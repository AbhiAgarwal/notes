My written notes are all over the place, and so is my writing. So I'm going to try and centralize it here for myself.

Concentration on languages: C++, Javascript, and Go. I'm just going to be using these languages for the next couple years of my life - it's better to perfect myself with a couple languages rather than having learnt all the languages not too well.

**Reference the Wiki page for my quick notes.**

**Things to learn**

<p>To give me a good general background in Computer Science, and allow me to branch out in the future - I want to study the following things at University. I want to build on them and to understand how these things operate, and be able to apply most of these concepts.</p>

<p>Crossing out doesn't mean I have reached my goal in these languages, but just means that I have developed a decent understanding of them</p>

<p>I want to try and understand these ideas. Not just from a developer's prespective, but also from a mathematicians side. So that means that try and understand how they are implemented, and not just how to use them.</p>

<p>Also these are concepts I want to learn on a more fundamental level. These concepts are fairly hard to start approach on a more advanced level.</p>

- Algorithm Design
- Artificial Intelligence (NLP, Vision, Speech, Movement)
- Robotics (Mechanics, Electrical, Computer)
- Parallel Programming (OpenCL, OpenMP, CUDA)
- Languages (~~Node.js, Javascript, Python,~~ Haskell, ~~Java, C++~~)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV), and Computer Graphics
- Machine Learning (Theory, Frameworks (scikit-learn, etc), and Kaggle Implementations)
- Deep Learning (Neural nets)
- Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Inequality, Dimensionality, Calculus)
- Physics (Kinemetics)
- Simulation (~~N-body, Diseases, Traffic~~, Movement, Social)
- Networking (Packets, TCP/IP, Packet Sniffing)
- Competitive Programming (~~UVA, Algorithmic efficiency~~)
- Data Compression techniques (Lossy, Lossless Compression, and theory (Entropy, etc. ))

<p>Interests in understanding these concepts</p>

- Brain (Visual cortex -> V1, V2, ..., Neurons, etc)
- The Maze Idea (in Startup Engineering Course)
- Facial Detection, and Recognition in Computer Vision extensively

<p>More simpler things to understand, and just play around with</p>

3. Gradle
4. Maven
5. Google's build system - http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/08/build-in-cloud-how-build-system-works.html
6. Pants (Twitter, Foursquare) - aka Python Ant

<p>Away from academia</p>

- Social Media (How people response/react to)
- Marketing
- Entreprunership

<p>Cool frameworks</p>

**Writing**

<p>My own personal writing on topics I think are worth learning and understanding. I will write them as I learn so I can share the process of learning these things. I'll leave them for people to read as I write them as well.</p>

- [Automatic facial detection and recognition](./Automatic facial detection and recognition.md)
- [Startups](./startups.md)
- [Bitcoin](./bitcoin.md)

**My Log**

<p>I log what I learn everyday [here](./log.md)</p>
