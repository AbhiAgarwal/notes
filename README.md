**Things to learn**

<p>To give me a good general background in Computer Science, and allow me to branch out in the future - I want to study the following things at University. I want to build on them and to understand how these things operate, and be able to apply most of these concepts.</p>

<p>Crossing out doesn't mean I have reached my goal in these languages, but just means that I have developed a decent understanding of them</p>

- Artificial Intelligence (NLP, Vision, Speech, Movement)
- Robotics (Mechanics, Electrical, Computer)
- Parallel Programming (OpenCL, OpenMP, CUDA)
- Languages (~~Node.js, Javascript, Python,~~ Haskell, ~~Java, C++~~)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV), and Computer Graphics
- Machine Learning (Theory, and Frameworks (scikit-learn, etc))
- Deep Learning (Neural nets)
- Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Inequality)
- Physics (Kinemetics)
- Simulation (~~N-body, diseases, traffic~~, movement, social)

Away from academia

- Social Media (How people response/react to)
