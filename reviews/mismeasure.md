Gould points out flaws in using only a single entity, intelligence, to judge the knowledge and advancements of a whole civilization, and accuses Morton of selectively report data and basically 'scientific racism'. Gould leaves a powerful message that we have a habit of taking very complex things and ranking them unfairly. 

A question I don't quite understand is how a man of mathematics and science could even consider using just a couple of categories (i.e.: skull size) to determine intelligence of a whole civilization. He was said to be highly trained for different universities, and was accomplished in his field.

Are people more likely to believe things said by science? Morton claimed that different races are differently intelligent, but do people agree with that? Do people think that because he/she is from a science background they would agree that they're less intelligent and therefore as Morton implied a different species.
