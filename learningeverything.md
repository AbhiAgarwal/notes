# Learning everything

It's hard for a person to learn everything. Being in the tech industry there's 1000's of new things to learn everything as research moves forward, and as languages develop. There's literally a new language or a feature that you've to know about every single week, and it's tiring for people to keep up with them.

There's opinions or reviews people post about languages, which make people panic and want to learn that language, and I think that it's creating a weird environment. As a student I'm trying to learn and understand language features, but every time there's a new trend my mind starts to wonder and I feel like learning a new language, but is that right? As a student, and a person not currently working there's a pressure over my head to learn something new, and keep up with the new trend.

It creates panic because not all the students are in the valley, and know about the things they have to learn or can predict how the tech industry is going to move forward. This is why when a new trend comes we jump on the train and run with it, but I want to stop this so I can focus on learning a single language in depth. 

I want to focus on learning a few concepts in depth rather than knowing everything, but wouldn't knowing everything also help? Shouldn't I be learning all the things so I'm able to apply a lot of concepts and bring new ideas to where I go work? Or learning new languages and languages across paradigms so I can get employers to know how talented I am? 

All these things are things I think about on a day-to-day basis. I work on a lot of projects so I do get exposure to a lot languages, but nowadays I'm moving towards using a couple of languages rather than literally all of them. I think I should take the pressure off wanting to learn everything I see on Hacker News or everything people post on tech blogs. I should take note of trends, but move away from wanting to read and learn every single trend. 

It shouldn't matter to me that people are learning Swift or moving to Go or adopting Rust. I should focus on the languages I think are important to me, and learn the other languages in my spare time. It's important to know languages, but learning a language in depth is more important. It doesn't matter what language you are working on, but it should be important that you know how to work in that environment efficiently.
