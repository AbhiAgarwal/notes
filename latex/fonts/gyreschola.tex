\item[Schola / Century Schoolbook:]
The original Century Schoolbook was designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1919
at the request of Ginn \& Co., a textbook publisher, who were looking for an
especially easy-to-read face for textbooks.  It is now familiar to many
North Americans as the typeface they first learned to read with.\\
Usage: \textbackslash usepackage\{tgschola\}
