{\LARGE 5 Venturis ADF}\\
~\\
After Adobe finally open-sourced the Utopia font-family in 2006,
font-designer Hirwen Harendal of the Arkandis Digital Foundry made the first
legal derivative and released it in 2007 on behalf of the \TeX{} Users
Group.  The Venturis suite of typefaces are characterized by a smaller
x-height and an even more ``square'' feeling than Utopia.  The Venturis
collection consists of the following three typefaces.

%The ADF has three purposes. The first is provide fonts to allow for artistic
%creativity in publications for those who cannot afford the cost of
%commercial font families. The second is to protect the works of professional
%font foundries and designers from the illegal use of their fonts in
%publications or for commercial use by providing these free alternatives. The
%last is that making fonts is a great pleasure.
