Top 10 LaTeX Fonts
==================

Instead of working on my thesis, I created this project to showcase the beauty and history of the most popular LaTeX fonts. Every font is described by a paragraph that is also set in that font, made possible by the dvipng utility that creates PNG images from DVI originals.

You can view the result on http://r2src.github.io/top10fonts/

Creating the images
-------------------

If you make a change to any .tex file, run `make` to automatically update the necessary PNG images. You will need a very complete LaTeX installation to successfully compile all the files.
