### Artificial Intelligence programs

### Legends

- [Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist)
	- It was the first program deliberately engineered to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being and is called "the first artificial intelligence program."
	- Logic Theorist soon proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in chapter 2 of the Principia Mathematica.

### Performance evaluations in AI

- optimal: it is not possible to perform better
- strong super-human: performs better than all humans
- super-human: performs better than most humans
- par-human: performs similarly to most humans
- sub-human: performs worse than most humans

##### Optimal

Any solved game (a game whose outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, given that both players play perfectly) can reach optimal position. 

- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect Four
- Checkers
- Rubik's Cube
- Computer poker players, sub-human for full ring Texas hold 'em (approaching strong super-human in simpler versions of poker)

##### Super-human

- Backgammon: super-human
- Bridge: nearing strong super-human
- Chess: nearing strong super-human
- Crosswords: super-human
- Driving a car: super-human. Google driverless cars are safer and smoother when steering themselves than when a human takes the wheel.
- Jigsaw puzzles: strong super-human
- Reversi: strong super-human
- Scrabble: strong super-human
- Quiz show question answering: strong super-human

##### Par-human

- Optical character recognition for ISO 1073-1:1976 and similar special characters.
- Go
- Arimaa

#### Sub-human

- Optical character recognition for printed text (nearing par-human for Latin-script typewritten text)
- Handwriting recognition
- Object recognition
- Translation
- Speech recognition
- Word-sense disambiguation
- Natural language processing
